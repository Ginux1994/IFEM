This is the source of the prototype spline/NURBS-based FEM solver
developed for the ICADA project at SINTEF ICT in Trondheim.

The Makefile is for compilation on Linux.
It assumes that the libraries liblapack and libblas are installed.
In addition, the following dependencies on 3rd party libraries are present:

Required:
GoTools	- Download and install from the source code repository at
	http://svn.math.sintef.no. See also the wiki documentation at
	http://svn.math.sintef.no/index.php/Some_info_about_the_GoTools_and_SISL_SVN_repositories
	The libraries are assumed found in the sub-folder GoTools/lib
	The header files are assumed found in the sub-folder GoTools/include
	The GoTools packages require that the libboost package is installed.

ARPACK	- Download and compile from http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK

Optional:
SAM	- A few fortran subroutine from the SAM library by Kolbein Bell
	can be used for the assembly of element matrices into system matrices.
	In addition, the sparse solver SPR from this library can be used.
	It is possible to compile without the SAM library, by commenting out
        the symbols SAMOPT and SAMLIB in the Makefile.

SuperLU	- This is a public domain package for direct solution of non-symmetric
	sparse equation systems. The source code is available from
	http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU. To compile without it, comment out
	the symbol definitions SLUOPT and SLULIB in the Makefile

SAMG	- This is a commercial package (algebraic multigrid solver) and is
	included for testing only. To compile without it, comment out the
	symbol definitions SAMGOPT and SAMGLIB in the Makefile.

GLviewExpressWriter - Ceetron's VTF API. If you don't have it, comment out the
	symbol defintions VTFOPT and VTFLIB in the Makefile.
